## Technologies Used

I've utilized a combination of cutting-edge technologies to build this portfolio website, ensuring a high-performance, visually appealing, and efficient user experience.

- **Next.js:** I chose Next.js as the foundation of my portfolio website due to its powerful features for building modern web applications. By leveraging Next.js's static rendering capabilities, my site achieves excellent performance and faster loading times. Additionally, the built-in server-side rendering (SSR) ensures that content is delivered to users swiftly, enhancing both SEO and user experience.

- **Tailwind CSS:** For styling, I harnessed the power of Tailwind CSS. This utility-first CSS framework allowed me to rapidly design and customize components, resulting in a visually cohesive and responsive design. Tailwind CSS's optimized styling approach also contributes to quicker loading times, keeping the user engaged without compromising on aesthetics.

- **Markdown to JSON API:** The backend of my site employs an API route that transforms local Markdown files into JSON data. This approach enables me to maintain my project and content data in Markdown files, making it easy to update and manage. By converting these files to JSON via an API, I ensure that the content is readily available for rendering on the frontend, providing a seamless and dynamic user experience.
