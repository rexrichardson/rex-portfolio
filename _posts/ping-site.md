## Developing a New Ping Proxies Site

The task at hand was to engineer a new website for Ping Proxies, with a key objective to enhance the site's performance, improve the design of the site and incorporate a CMS for easy updates and page building.

### Front End Design and Development

To kickstart the process, I used Tailwind.UI for a swift and efficient user interface design. This involved a mix of readily available components and fully custom ones tailored to fit the site's unique requirements. Next, I employed Next.js for static rendering, resulting in impressively high-performing pages, boasting a 98 score on Google Page Speed Insights.

Sanity, a headless CMS, played a pivotal role in structuring the website's content. I devised Sanity page and component schemas to streamline the process of content creation and updates. I adopted a page builder approach, enabling the creation of pages with any component directly in Sanity, which the website would then render seamlessly.

In my code, this was made possible using a modular component with a switch statement. This flexible structure made it possible for any component created in Sanity to be accurately represented on the live site.

### Final Result

The revamped Ping Proxies website stands as a testament to the potent combination of efficient UI design, high-performance static pages, and flexible content management, achieving a comprehensive upgrade of its digital presence.
