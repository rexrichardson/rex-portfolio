## A sneaker price comparison site

I designed, built and launched [SoleSpy](https://www.solespy.co.uk). The primary feature of the site is comparing sneaker marketplaces at a size specific level. Solespy provides transparent pricing: all the prices we show are all inclusive of fees and shipping costs of the respective marketplace. We also provide release guides for upcoming drops, in addition to sneaker news.

### Building a Sneaker Database: Structuring and Gathering Data

In the initial stage of developing SoleSpy, I focused on creating a robust sneaker database. By carefully planning the structure and necessary data fields, I laid the foundation for a comprehensive collection. Through meticulous research and utilizing reliable sources, I curated data on thousands of popular sneakers, populating the MongoDB database. To ensure the database remained up-to-date, I developed a script that continuously added new sneakers to the collection.

### Overcoming Challenges: Transparent Pricing and Scalable Data Structure

Implementing transparent pricing was a key goal for SoleSpy, but it came with challenges. I faced difficulties in acquiring pricing data from sneaker marketplaces and encountered variations in shoe size classifications across platforms. Through innovative problem-solving, I developed scalable Python scripts that fetched pricing data and addressed the discrepancies. These intelligent scripts adapted the frequency of querying based on each shoe's popularity, ensuring accurate and real-time pricing information.

### Designing the Front End: Aesthetic Appeal and Fast Load Times

With the assistance of Figma, I crafted a visually appealing and user-friendly front-end design for SoleSpy. The next.js framework, with its static rendering capabilities, was chosen to optimize site performance and achieve rapid load times. Months of dedication were invested in refining the design to create an intuitive interface that enhances the user experience.

SoleSpy's front-end design goes beyond just integrating MongoDB for displaying sneakers and their pricing. To provide a comprehensive user experience, I utilized Sanity.io to incorporate a fully-fledged blog system that is SEO-optimized. This addition allows SoleSpy to offer engaging and informative blog content, ensuring maximum visibility and discoverability for sneaker enthusiasts. By seamlessly integrating MongoDB and Sanity.io, SoleSpy provides a holistic platform with comprehensive sneaker data and a dynamic, SEO-optimized blog system.

### Launch and Success: Empowering Sneakerheads and Driving Revenue

SoleSpy has made a significant impact since its launch. Despite being in its infancy, the platform has already generated over Â£18,000 in revenue for UK sneaker marketplaces. This early success highlights the trust and value that SoleSpy brings to both buyers and sellers in the sneaker community.

Moreover, SoleSpy has garnered considerable attention, despite limited marketing, attracting over 30,000 unique visitors. The positive response and growing user base validate the relevance and effectiveness of the platform.
