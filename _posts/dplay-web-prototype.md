## A react.js prototype for Dplay

During my time at Dplay (now Discovery+), I personally created a web prototype to see how effective the design team's design system was in practise. This involved implementing several values that varied at different breakpoints such as spacing, font sizes, interactions (hover, focus, active) and grids. The prototype was developed for all breakpoints from moibile to TV. View the project in action in the video below.
