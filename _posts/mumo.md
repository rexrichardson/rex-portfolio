I was tasked with developing a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) prototype for a ticketing application startup, Mumo.io. Leveraging my expertise in React Native, Expo, and Firebase, I selected these technologies to form the core of the tech stack.

In my development process, I meticulously replicated the UI designs provided to me, ensuring that the final product not only matched the envisioned aesthetics but also integrated high-quality animations. This attention to detail was crucial in delivering an engaging and seamless user experience.

A key aspect of this project was integrating Firebase Authentication and Firebase Firestore. This allowed for robust user authentication and efficient data display within the app, enhancing both security and functionality.

Furthermore, I developed a custom admin dashboard using Next.js 13. This dashboard enables easy management and addition of events to the app, offering a streamlined backend solution for the administrative team.

These efforts culminated in a comprehensive and user-friendly MVP that met the startup's requirements and set a strong foundation for future development.
